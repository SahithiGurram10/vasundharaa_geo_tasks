React Intern Assignment – Vasundharaa Geo Technologies
This repository contains the solutions for the React Developer Intern Assignment. The project demonstrates core and advanced React concepts including component-based architecture, state management, form handling, localStorage usage, UI synchronization, and dynamic rendering.

1. Tech Stack


React.js


JavaScript (ES6+)


HTML5 & CSS3


LocalStorage


CSS Modules / Tailwind CSS (for styling)



2. Steps to Run the Project Locally
  1.Prerequisites


   Node.js version: v16 or above

   npm version: v8 or above


  2.Installation Steps
   git clone <your-github-repo-link>
   cd <project-folder>
   npm install

3.Start Command
npm start

The application will run at:
http://localhost:3000


📝 Implemented Tasks
 Task 1: Todo Application


Add, delete, and mark tasks as completed


Filter tasks (All / Active / Completed)


Task priority selection


Data persistence using localStorage


Responsive and clean UI


Task 2: Form Handling & Password Toggle


Controlled form inputs


Inline validation with error messages


Show/Hide password feature


Form data display after submission


Auto-clear form after successful submit


Task 3: Dynamic Progress Bar


Multiple numeric inputs (0–100)


Main progress bar with sub-bars


Animated fill and dynamic color changes


Input value validation


Task 4: Advanced Countdown Timer


Start, Pause, Resume, and Reset controls


Millisecond-accurate countdown


Persistent timer state across refresh


Dynamic button enable/disable


Status display (Running / Paused / Completed)


Task 5: Live Search with Highlighting


Case-insensitive search


Highlight matched text (multiple occurrences)


Display result count


“No matches found” handling



Assumptions & Design Decisions


Each task is implemented as a separate reusable component


React Hooks (useState, useEffect) are used for state and side effects


LocalStorage is used instead of backend APIs for persistence


UI focus is on clarity, responsiveness, and usability



 Limitations / Trade-offs


No backend integration (frontend-only assignment)


Styling focused on simplicity rather than heavy animations


LocalStorage data is browser-specific



Code Quality Standards Followed


Modular and reusable components


Meaningful variable and function names


Clean formatting and consistent code style


Clear separation of concerns



Notes


Assignment completed within the given timeline


No copy-pasted or auto-generated logic used


All features implemented with proper understanding
