# React Form Handling App

A simple and well-structured React application built as part of a React internship assignment to demonstrate form handling, validation, and password visibility toggle.

## 1. Brief of Project

This project is a React-based form handling application that allows users to enter their personal details such as Name, Email, ID, and Password. On form submission, the application validates user input, prevents page reload, and displays the submitted data below the form.

The application focuses on demonstrating core React concepts including controlled components, state management using React Hooks, form validation, conditional rendering, and component reusability. A Show/Hide Password feature is implemented to enhance user experience.

This project is designed to be clean, beginner-friendly, and aligned with real-world React development practices.
